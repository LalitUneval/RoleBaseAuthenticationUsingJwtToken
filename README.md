# RoleBaseAuthenticationUsingJwtToken
In this project, both users and admins can log in. After successful authentication, the server returns a JWT token. This token can be used in subsequent requests, so the user or admin does not need to log in again using a username and password. The token must be included in the request header for accessing protected routes.Techno :
